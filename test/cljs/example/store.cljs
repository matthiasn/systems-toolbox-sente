  "In this namespace, the app state is managed. One can only interact with the state by sending
  immutable messages. Each such message is then handled by a handler function. These handler functions
  here are pure functions, they receive message and previous state and return the new state.

  Both the messages passed around and the new state returned by the handlers are validated using
  clojure.spec. This eliminates an entire class of possible bugs, where failing to comply with
  data structure expectations might now immediately become obvious."
